## Objective:
Welcome to my showcase project where I demonstrate my skills in backend and frontend development by creating a virtual shop application. This project utilizes Python for backend logic, SQLite for database management, and Tkinter for the frontend user interface. Feedback is appreciated, and I am open to contributions and collaboration opportunities.

## Features:

1. **User Interface (Frontend - Tkinter):**
   - Displays a menu of available items to the customer.
   - Enables customers to click and purchase one item at a time.

2. **Backend (SQLite):**
   - Manages a database of items including details such as item name and price.
   - Updates the stock quantity in real-time as customers make purchases.

## Workflow:

1. **Customer Interaction:**
   - Customers open the app and view a menu of available items.
   - Customers click on an item to purchase it.
   - The app checks the stock level in the database.
   - If the item is in stock, the app decreases the stock quantity by one and confirms the purchase.
   - If the item is out of stock, the app notifies the customer and promises delivery in three days.

2. **Inventory Management:**
   - Each time a purchase is made, the app updates the item's stock level in the SQLite database.

## Technical Details:

- **Database Schema:**
  - Table: `items`
    - Columns: `id`, `name`, `price`

- **Tkinter Components:**
  - Main window displaying the menu of items.
  - Buttons for each item to initiate a purchase.

- **Notifications:**
  - Seller Notification: A message or alert when stock reaches zero.
  - Customer Notification: A message indicating order delay and delivery timeline.

## Implementation Plan:

1. **Set up SQLite database:**
   - Create the `items` table.
   - Populate the table with initial data.

2. **Build Tkinter Interface:**
   - Design the main window layout.
   - Create buttons for item interaction.

3. **Integrate Backend with Frontend:**
   - Connect Tkinter buttons to database operations.
   - Implement stock level updates.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test the purchasing process.
   - Ensure smooth user experience and accurate stock tracking.

## Conclusion:

This showcase project aims to highlight my skills in backend and frontend development by creating a seamless virtual shopping experience for customers while efficiently managing inventory. Your feedback is valuable, and I am eager to explore collaboration opportunities.
